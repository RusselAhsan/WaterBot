# WaterBot
Discord bot that reminds users to drink water periodically, allows users to notify bot when they have had water, and displays leaderboard (top 3) of users who have drank the most water.

Later updates have included minigames such as Hangman and Connect4, a magic eight ball, dog and cat image commands, and deprecated interaction with the Bungie API to see playing time data.
